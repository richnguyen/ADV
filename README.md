Project ADV - Automated Driving Vehicle 

The project is implemented in MATLAB. The motion planner software, called Simulator AVD, is developed as the result of the method. Simulator ADV offers an array of amazing features in which users can experience. Below is a few key features that is available in Simulator ADV.

Key Features

### Interactive inputs

You will get to decide where the obstacles (buildings and parked car) as well as the intial and starting position should be. After each simulation, you can decide to keep the obstacle for the next one by simple choosing reload option.

### Two motion modes

There's two modes of motion you can choose from: driving or drifting. When driving is selected, you robot will move like a car. You will experience the real motion of car driving. When drifting is selected, you robot will move like a walking robot.

### Step-by-step simulation

The machanism of RRTs can be clearly explained in step-by-step simulation. The animation shows how the RRT trees in constructed and grow. User can gain a true understanding on how RRT works by looking at the simulation.

### Robot's attribute tunning

You get to tune how fast should the car-robot go, how sharp should it turn. You can also determine the shape of the car, should it a long van, or big SUV, or a small compact. It's all up to you!
